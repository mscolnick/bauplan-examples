# Iceberg Lakehouse and Write-Audit-Publish

In this example, we illustrate how to embed the **bauplan import data API** into an orchestration flow.  
We provide a reference implementation of the **write-audit-publish** pattern using bauplan and [Prefect 3.0](https://docs-3.prefect.io/3.0/get-started/index).
