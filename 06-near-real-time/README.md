# Near Real-time Analytics Pipeline with bauplan

A demo implementing near real-time analytics for e-commerce data using bauplan, [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Overview

This example shows how to:
1. Create analytics tables in Bauplan using the "public.ecommerce" dataset (from [Kaggle's E-commerce Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store/data))
2. Simulate streaming data by appending rows to core tables and rebuilding downstream tables using Prefect for orchestration
3. Implement data branching strategies based on the [Write-Audit-Publish pattern](https://github.com/BauplanLabs/wap_with_bauplan_and_prefect/tree/main) to isolate ingestion from pipeline artifacts
4. Visualize live results through a Streamlit dashboard reflecting the latest data from the main branch

The project demonstrates near real-time processing, SQL/Python transformations, branch-based development, and live metric visualization.

## Prerequisites

### bauplan API key

👉👉👉 To use Bauplan, you need an API key for our preview environment: you can request one [here](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/#join). To get familiar with the API, start with our [tutorial](https://docs.bauplanlabs.com/en/latest/tutorial/01_quick_start.html#)

### AWS Setup
To simulate a continuous stream of incoming data, we use an S3 bucket. You'll need AWS credentials with permissions to:
- Create and manage S3 buckets
- Upload files
- List bucket contents


## Quick Start (Three Terminal Setup)

### Terminal 1: Environment

Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Terminal 2: Prefect Server
```bash
prefect server start
```

Keep this terminal running - it hosts the Prefect server that manages the scheduled tasks.


### Terminal 1: Prefect Setup and Run Pipeline


Configure Prefect (required before first run)
```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

Set up AWS credentials in one of two ways:

1. Environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='your-region'  # e.g., us-east-1
```

2. AWS config file (recommended):
Follow the [AWS CLI configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

After setting up AWS credentials, run:

```bash
cd orchestrator
python run.py --username your_bauplan_username \
              --namespace your_namespace \
              --dev_branch your_branch \
              --bucket_name your_bucket_name
```

### Terminal 3: Streamlit Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```
Keep this terminal running to maintain the dashboard server.

## Project Structure

```

## What Happens When You Run the Script

### First Run: ONE-OFF Setup (utils.py)
1. Creates development branch from main
2. Builds initial cleaned dataset
3. Sets up S3 bucket for simulated events

### Every 5 Minutes: Scheduled Operations (run.py)
1. Simulates new e-commerce events
2. Ingests data using temporary branches
3. Updates analytics tables

## Analytics pipeline (pipeline_analytics forlder)
This creates a full funnel of metrics from browsing (views) to purchasing (revenue), enabling analysis of:
- User engagement (sessions)
- Conversion (purchases)
- Revenue performance
- Brand-level trends
- Hourly patterns

Here's an explanation of the analytics pipeline files:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Input Table"
    A[ecommerce_clean]
    end

    subgraph "Intermediate Tables"
    B[purchase_sessions.sql]
    C[metrics_orders.sql]
    end

    subgraph "Final Metrics"
    D[ecommerce_metrics_base]
    end

    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    B --> D


```

## Data Viz
The project includes a simple Streamlit dashboard  `dashboard/app.py` to visualize the final aggregated metrics from our analytics pipeline.
The dashboard provides an easy way to monitor the calculated metrics with minimal setup.

### Usage
The visualization is straightforward:
1. Select your Bauplan username from the dropdown
2. Choose the branch created by the analytics pipeline
3. View your metrics instantly
