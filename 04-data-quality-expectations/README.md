# Data Quality and Expectations

In this example, we illustrate how to use expectation tests. These tests are statistical and quality checks applied to Bauplan models to ensure that the structure and values of the data meet our expectations. Expectation tests help detect data quality issues early and can be incorporated seamlessly into various workflows.

## Preliminary steps
